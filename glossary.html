    <h1>HTML Glossary</h1>

    <h2>Figcaption and Figure</h2>

    <p>The HTML figure element represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption figurcaption, and is typically referenced as a single unit.
    Usually a figure is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
    The HTML figurcaption element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents its parent figure element, if any.</p>

    <h1>Headings</h1>

    <p>The HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. h1 is the highest section level and h6 is the lowest.
    Avoid skipping heading levels: always start from h1, next use h2 and so on.
    Note:Do not use lower levels to decrease heading font size: use the CSS font-size property instead.</p>

    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading level 6</h6>

    <h1>Lists</h1>

    <p>HTML supports two kinds of lists: ordered lists and unordered lists.The HTML ol element represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list, while the ul element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.The li element is used to represent an item in a list.</p>

    <h1>CSS Glossary</h1>

    <h2>Padding</h2>

    <p>The padding is the spacing between the content and the border (edge of the element.). We can adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content. Here, the div with id 'box' will get 10px of padding all around it.</p>


    <h2>Margin</h2>

    <p>The margin is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other. Here, the div with id 'box' will get 10px of margin above and below it, and 5px of margin to the left and right.</p>


    <h2>Font-Family</h2>

    <p>The font-family CSS property specifies a prioritized list of one or more font family names and/or generic family names for the selected element.
    Values are separated by commas to indicate that they are alternatives. The browser will select the first font in the list that is installed or that can be downloaded.
    You should always include at least one generic family name in a font-family list, since there's no guarantee that any given font is available. This lets the browser select an acceptable fallback font when necessary.</p>

    <h2>Media Queries</h2>

    <p>Media queries let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters.
    They are a key component of responsive design. For example, a media query can shrink the font size on small devices, increase the padding between paragraphs when a page is viewed in portrait mode, or bump up the size of buttons on touchscreens.
    In CSS, use the @media at-rule to conditionally apply part of a style sheet based on the result of a media query. Use @import to conditionally apply an entire style sheet.</p>
