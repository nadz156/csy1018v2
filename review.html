              <h1>Codecademy</h1>
              <p>Codecademy improved a lot lately. This course teaches you how to make a website. It consists of five different units, and it guides you from the basics of HTML to the basics of CSS. There are many advantages to using Codecademy; one of the biggest being that it’s free. Unlike many of its competitors, you don’t have to sign up for a monthly subscription or pay by the class. For someone on a tight budget, that can be the deciding factor. Another advantage is that Codecademy makes it possible for you to learn the syntax of a programming language via an interactive experience in your web browser. What I like about this course is that you’re actually building a recent version of Airbnb’s website and that you’ll also learn about CSS frameworks like Bootstrap as having some knowledge about Bootstrap can be very useful. However, Codecademy is nothing short of prolific, and one of their best features is just the breadth of their offerings. To date they have tutorials on HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Rails, AngularJS, ReactJS, Ruby, Command Line, Git, SQL, and Java. More than enough to keep you busy for a while, and more than enough opportunities for you to determine whether you like this whole coding thing and want to give it a real go. However, one negative would be they have no video instructions which may be an issue for visual learners who require live demonstrations as opposed to step-by-step instructions. Long story short: a really nice course that teaches you all the basics you need to know whilst makes learning to code fun and rewarding, and offering plenty of help along the way.</p>

                <h1>W3Schools</h1>
                <p>I know they're notorious for previously having outdated content, but W3Schools offers a very nice course on HTML & CSS. The course contains a lot information and quizzes and they are very nice. At the end of each tutorial, you can find over 200 examples and exercises. You can edit and test each example yourself. The nice part about W3Schools, besides being super comprehensive, is that you can code directly in the editor on their website. What that means is if you don't understand the context of the coding or how it would look, they have programmed examples with an option to look at them and change the coding live to see how it affects the output. W3Schools also has several other useful tools, such as a hexadecimal colour picker, and full references for every single programming language they cover. I have used both of these tools and found them extremely helpful. It is also a good place to get current OS, platform and browser usage statistics – useful for when sites claim that this or that browser is becoming one of the most widely used. Best of all, the courses are free of cost - no basic trial thing-pay-them-then-the real deal. Therefore, W3Schools is a great resource for anyone looking to learn HTML and CSS in depth due to its comprehensive suite of tools and fully-fledged functionality.</p>
